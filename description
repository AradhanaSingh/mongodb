MongoDB  stores  data  in  the  form  of documents, which  are  JSON-like  field  and  value  pairs.
Documents  are analogous  to  structures  in  programming  languages  that  associate  keys  with  values  (e.g.    dictionaries,  hashes,
maps,  and  associative  arrays)

Formally,  MongoDB  documents  are BSON documents.   BSON  is  a  binary  representation  of JSON with  additional  type  information. 
MongoDB stores all documents in collections.  A collection is a group of related documents that have a set of shared common indexes.
Collections are analogous to a table in relational databases

Relational DB -> NOSQL DB

Table -> Collection

Row  -> Document

Column -> Field

Relationships -> Linking and Embedding Documents
